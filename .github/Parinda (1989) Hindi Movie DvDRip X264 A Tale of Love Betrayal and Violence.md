## Parinda (1989) Hindi Movie DvDRip X264: A Classic Crime Thriller
  
Parinda is not only a gripping story of brotherhood, love and revenge, but also a realistic depiction of the Mumbai underworld in the late 1980s. The movie shows the brutal and ruthless nature of the gangsters, who do not hesitate to kill anyone who comes in their way. The movie also exposes the corruption and inefficiency of the police and the judiciary, who are either helpless or complicit in the crimes. The movie does not shy away from showing the graphic violence and bloodshed that result from the gang wars, making it one of the most violent movies of its time.
  
The movie also boasts of some excellent technical aspects, such as the cinematography by Binod Pradhan, who captures the dark and gritty atmosphere of the city with his innovative camera angles and lighting. The editing by Renu Saluja is crisp and fast-paced, keeping the viewers on the edge of their seats. The music by R.D. Burman is another highlight of the movie, as it blends well with the mood and tone of the movie. The songs are melodious and haunting, especially "Tumse Milke", which is considered one of the best romantic songs ever composed by Burman.
  
The movie also features some outstanding performances by its lead actors. Jackie Shroff delivers one of his best performances as Kishan, the elder brother who is torn between his loyalty to Anna and his love for his brother. He portrays his character's inner conflict and guilt with subtlety and intensity. Anil Kapoor is equally impressive as Karan, the younger brother who is naive and innocent at first, but becomes determined and courageous later. He shows his versatility and range as an actor in this movie. Nana Patekar steals the show as Anna, the psychotic and sadistic gangster who is obsessed with fire. He plays his role with such conviction and charisma that he makes Anna one of the most memorable villains in Indian cinema. Madhuri Dixit is charming and graceful as Paro, the innocent girl who falls in love with Karan. She brings a touch of freshness and beauty to the otherwise dark movie.
