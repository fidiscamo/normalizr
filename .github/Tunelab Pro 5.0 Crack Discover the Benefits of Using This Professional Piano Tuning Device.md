# How to Tune Your Piano with TuneLab Pro 5.0
 
If you are looking for a professional piano tuning software that can turn any Windows laptop or tablet computer into a high-quality electronic tuning device, you should check out TuneLab Pro 5.0. TuneLab Pro 5.0 is a powerful and user-friendly tool that can help you tune your piano with accuracy and ease. Here are some of the features and benefits of using TuneLab Pro 5.0 for your piano tuning needs.
 
## Ideal Tuning Curves
 
TuneLab Pro 5.0 can automatically adjust the ideal tuning curves for any piano, based on the measured inharmonicity of each note. Inharmonicity is the deviation of the partials (overtones) of a string from their ideal harmonic ratios, which affects the perceived pitch and tone quality of the note. TuneLab Pro 5.0 can calculate the inharmonicity for every note based on just a few readings, and then apply the appropriate tuning curve to achieve a smooth and harmonious sound across the keyboard.

TuneLab Pro 5.0 also supports 3-part tuning, which is well-suited for perfect 12th tuning. Perfect 12th tuning is a method of tuning that aims to make the intervals of octaves and 12ths as pure as possible, while compromising on other intervals such as 4ths and 5ths. This results in a rich and resonant sound that is especially pleasing for classical music.
 
## Pitch-Raise Mode
 
If your piano is significantly out of tune, you may need to perform a pitch-raise before fine-tuning. A pitch-raise is a process of raising or lowering the overall tension of the strings to bring them closer to their target pitch. TuneLab Pro 5.0 has a special pitch-raise mode that can help you do this quickly and efficiently. TuneLab Pro 5.0 will guide you through the pitch-raise process by showing you how much each note needs to be adjusted, and by automatically switching to the next note when you reach the desired pitch.
 
## Automatic Note Switching
 
One of the most convenient features of TuneLab Pro 5.0 is its automatic note switching function. This means that you don't have to manually select each note on the screen as you tune your piano. Instead, TuneLab Pro 5.0 will automatically detect the note that you are playing on your piano keyboard, and display its pitch information on the screen. This saves you time and hassle, and allows you to focus on tuning your piano accurately.

## Split-Scale Tuning Curves
 
If you have a spinet piano, which is a type of small upright piano with shorter strings and lower tension, you may benefit from using split-scale tuning curves. Split-scale tuning curves are tuning curves that vary depending on the range of the keyboard, rather than being uniform across all notes. This is because spinet pianos tend to have more inharmonicity in their bass and treble sections than in their middle section, which affects their pitch perception and tone quality.
 
TuneLab Pro 5.0 can automatically generate split-scale tuning curves for spinet pianos based on their measured inharmonicity, and apply them to achieve a balanced and natural sound across all notes.
 
## Touchscreen Operation
 
TuneLab Pro 5.0 is designed to work seamlessly with touchscreen devices, such as Windows tablets or laptops with touchscreens. You can easily navigate through the program's menus and options by tapping or swiping on the screen, without needing a mouse or keyboard.
