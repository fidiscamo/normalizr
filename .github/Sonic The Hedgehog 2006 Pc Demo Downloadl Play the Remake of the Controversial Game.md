Note: Sonic The Hedgehog (P-06) is still in development and may not include all the levels and features of the original game. You can follow the progress of the project on YouTube[^3^] or Twitter (@GistixDev).
  
## Comparing with the Original Game
 
Sonic The Hedgehog 2006 is widely considered as one of the worst games in the Sonic franchise. The game received negative reviews from critics and fans alike for its poor graphics, glitches, loading times, and story[^4^] . The game also suffered from a rushed development cycle and a lack of quality control. Many fans were disappointed by the game's deviation from the classic Sonic formula and its inclusion of a human love interest for Sonic.

On the other hand, Sonic The Hedgehog (P-06) is a fan-made remake that tries to fix the flaws of the original game and make it more enjoyable. The remake improves the game's graphics, performance, and gameplay by using Unity Engine. The remake also removes some of the unnecessary features and characters from the original game and focuses more on Sonic's gameplay. The remake also adds some new features and content, such as a custom level editor and a challenge mode.
 
However, Sonic The Hedgehog (P-06) is not a perfect recreation of the original game. Some of the levels and features are still missing or incomplete. The remake also has some bugs and glitches of its own. The remake also does not change the game's story or voice acting, which some fans may still find unappealing. The remake is also not an official product and may face legal issues from Sega.
 
## Conclusion
 
Sonic The Hedgehog 2006 is a controversial game that has a loyal fanbase despite its flaws. If you want to play this game on PC, you have two options: either use an emulator or download a fan-made remake. Both methods have their pros and cons, so you should choose the one that suits your preferences and expectations. Either way, you can experience one of the most infamous games in Sonic history on your PC.
