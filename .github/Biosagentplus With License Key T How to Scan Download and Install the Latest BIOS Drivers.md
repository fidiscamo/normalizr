One of the most important aspects of BIOS Agent Plus is that it does not modify the Windows Registry area, and leftover files are not kept on the hard disk after removing the app. This makes it a safe and clean tool to use for your PC maintenance.
 
When you launch BIOS Agent Plus, it performs a thorough scan of your computer to check the status of your drivers. Once it finishes, it reveals the results in a web page loaded in your default web browser. You can see the status of your disk drives, display adapter, DVD/CD-ROM drives, human interface devices, keyboard, mouse and other pointing devices, and more.
 
If any of these items need an update, BIOS Agent Plus provides you with a shortcut link where you can get it. However, this feature is not available in the unregistered version of the program. You need to purchase a license key to unlock the full functionality of BIOS Agent Plus.
 
A license key for BIOS Agent Plus costs $29.95 and it is valid for one year. You can use it on up to 10 PCs. With a license key, you can download and install the latest drivers and BIOS updates for your PC with just one click. This can improve your PC performance, stability and security.
 
BIOS Agent Plus is compatible with all Windows versions, including Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10. It has a minimal impact on your system resources, as it uses low CPU and RAM during the scanning process. It displays accurate information without causing the operating system to hang, crash or pop up error dialogs.
