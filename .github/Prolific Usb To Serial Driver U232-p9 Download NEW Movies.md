## Linux
 
For Linux users, you do not need to download any driver as the kernel already supports the PL2303 chipset. However, you may need to configure some settings to enable the serial port communication. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Connect your USB Serial Port device to your computer and check its device name by typing `dmesg | grep tty` in a terminal. You should see something like `[    5.123456] usb 1-1: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0`.
2. Add yourself to the dialout group by typing `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` in a terminal. This will allow you to access the serial port without root privileges.
3. Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
4. You can now use any serial port terminal program (such as minicom, screen, picocom, etc.) to communicate with your USB Serial Port device. For example, if your device name is ttyUSB0 and its baud rate is 9600, you can type `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600` in a terminal to open a serial connection.

## Android
 
For Android users, you can download the driver SDK from the Prolific website[^2^]. The SDK contains sample code and documentation for developing Android applications that can communicate with USB Serial Port devices. The file name is PL2303G\_Android\_Driver\_SDK\_v1\_0\_0\_20190409.zip and the file size is 4.17 MB. To use the SDK, follow these steps:

1. Download the file and unzip it to your hard drive.
2. Open Android Studio and import the PL2303G\_Android\_Driver\_SDK project.
3. Connect your Android device to your computer and enable USB debugging mode.
4. Run the PL2303 8cf37b1e13
