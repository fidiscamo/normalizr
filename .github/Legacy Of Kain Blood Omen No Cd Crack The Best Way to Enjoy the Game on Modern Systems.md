A no CD crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the CD check and allows you to run the game from your hard drive. To use a no CD crack, you need to download it from a reliable source and replace the original executable file with it. Here are the steps to do that:
 
1. Make sure you have installed Legacy Of Kain Blood Omen on your PC. You can use the original CD or an ISO file mounted on a virtual drive.
2. Go to [GameCopyWorld](https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_legacy_of_kain.shtml) and search for "Legacy Of Kain Blood Omen". You will see several no CD cracks available for different versions of the game.
3. Download the no CD crack that matches your version of the game. For example, if you have the US version 1.0, download the US v1.0 No-CD Patch.
4. Extract the no CD crack file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a file named "KAIN.EXE".
5. Copy the "KAIN.EXE" file and paste it into the folder where you installed Legacy Of Kain Blood Omen. This will overwrite the original executable file.
6. Run the "KAIN.EXE" file and enjoy playing Legacy Of Kain Blood Omen without a CD.

Note: Some antivirus programs might detect the no CD crack as a virus or malware. This is a false positive and you can safely ignore it. However, make sure you download the no CD crack from a trusted source and scan it with your antivirus before using it.
